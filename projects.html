                        </summary>
                        <br>
                        <p>The website was developed by my colleague, and I joined the project to help publicise, form connections with the local community to integrate the website, and contribute to project planning and UX design. We planned changes to the website around the needs of the local community, and I also found new event feeds and groups for us to link in with.</p>
                        
                        <p>The aggregator was originally written in PHP, and then re-written using JavaScript / Node.js.</p>
                        
                        <p>My contributions here were more on the UX, project management, and user engagement side rather than technical, and I learned a lot from the project:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Importance of thinking about the needs of users</b> - both in designing features and in what to include & not include in a project.</li>
                            <li><b>Iterative process</b> - way of working where we continually optimise the project and user experience using feedback and monitoring performance.</li>  
                            <li><b>Accessibility</b> - we wanted to make the content available to people who couldnâ€™t / may not come across it online. We enabled a feature to print a weekly list of events from the website, which event organisers could use to have paper copies available at in person events. This was also a good way for new people to find out about the project.</li> 
                        </ul><br>
                        <p>This project is also interesting for me to look back on - while I was involved with it the tech side of it seemed daunting. Now that I am learning to code, I am interested in how it all!</p>

                        <p>Developed and maintained a wordpress based website for a community centre. Trained volunteers to update the website & write content. Click for more.</p>

                        <p>Manchester Social Centre was a volunteer community event space in Rusholme with a cafe. I developed using Wordpress and some HTML and CSS customisation, and taught volunteers how to update the website and add posts. </p>

                        <p>What I learned from this project:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Importance of thinking about the tech skill level of the future maintainers and users of a system will be when designing it. </li>
                            <li>How to communicate about technical issues to people with less experience.</li>
                            <li>Working as part of a large team to plan and deliver a project. I was developing the website alone, but the brief and content was decided by the whole community. </li>

                        </summary>
                        The website was developed by my colleague, and I joined the project to help publicise, form connections with the local community to integrate the website, and contribute to project planning and UX design. We planned changes to the website around the needs of the local community, and I also found new event feeds and groups for us to link in with. <br>
                        <br>
                        The aggregator was originally written in PHP, and then re-written using JavaScript / Node.js.<br>
                        <br>
                        My contributions here were more on the UX, project management, and user engagement side rather than technical, and I learned a lot from the project:
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Importance of thinking about the needs of users</b> - both in designing features and in what to include & not include in a project.</li>
                            <li><b>Iterative process</b> - way of working where we continually optimise the project and user experience using feedback and monitoring performance.</li>  
                            <li><b>Accessibility</b> - in this case even though we were running a website, we wanted to make the content available to people who couldn’t / may not come across it online. We enabled a feature to be able to print a weekly list of events from the website, which event organisers could download  and print to have available at in person events. Was also a good way for new people to find out about the project.</li> 
                        </ul><br>
                        This project is also interesting for me to look back on - while I was involved with it the tech side of it seemed daunting. Now that I am learning to code, I am interested in how it all!

We planned changes to the website around the needs of the local community, and I also found new event feeds and groups for us to link in with. 

My contributions here were more on the x y z side rather than technical, put I still learned a lot from the project:
Importance of thinking about the needs of users - both in designing features and in what to include & not include in a project
Iterative process - way of thinking that not final complete project but iteratively improve when get feedback from users and monitor performance. Having a list of items to improve & then prioritise work packets. 
Accessibility - in this case even though we were running a website, we wanted to make the content available to people who don’t regularly met online. This was achieved through a script - event organisers could download & print & leave flyers at events. Was also a good way for new people to find out about the project. 

This project is also interesting for me to look back on - while I was involved with it the tech side of it seemed daunting. Now that I am learning to code, I am interested in how it all worked & full circle.

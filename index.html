        <p id="text-body">Threaded throughout my work and volunteer experience, I’ve always had a passion for using technology to ‘make life easier’ and been the go-to person to build that project website / automate that task. 
            Building my own PC has inspired me to learn to code, starting off with community resources like FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. 
            
            <br> studied physics because I wanted to learn more about how the world around me works. Though I didn’t quite figure all of that out, my physics degree has given me a solid grounding in logic and creativity for problem solving. 
            
            <br>My work experience is mainly in the environmental sector, and I would love to eventually put my new skills to use in this sector.</p>

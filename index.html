        <h1> <b>Agnes Beviz</b> </h1>
        <p>I’m transitioning to software development from the environmental sector.. with a background in physics. I’ll be creating while I learn to code, and posting my writings and projects over here. </p>

            <h2><a name="aboutme" ></a>About me..</h2>
            <p id="text-body">Programming combines my passion for working with technical and creative mediums. I’ve always been curious and interested in how things work, which has led me to learning to code, via building my own PC! 

                <br>I’m starting off with HTML, CSS and JavaScript – initially with free community developed resources like freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. Already I’m finding that the problem solving approach and analytical thinking from my Physics Master is kicking in. 
                
                <br>My work experience is mainly in the environmental sector, and I would love to eventually put my new skills to use in this sector. </p>

            <h2><a name="blog"></a>Blog</h2>
            <p>Writing is one of the best ways to learn, and learning sparks so many ideas for writing. While I’m learning to code (a long process!) I’m going to use this corner to write about anything that inspires me – from diversity in tech to how to guides, to more obscure topics. </p>

        <p>I’m transitioning to software development from the environmental sector.. with a background in physics. I’ll be creating while I learn to code, and posting my writings and projects over here. </p>

            <p id="text-body">Threaded throughout my work and volunteer experience, I’ve always had a passion for using technology to ‘make life easier’ and been the go-to person to build that project website / automate that task. 
            Building my own PC has inspired me to learn to code, starting off with community resources like FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. 
            
            <br> studied physics because I wanted to learn more about how the world around me works. Though I didn’t quite figure all of that out, my physics degree has given me a solid grounding in logic and creativity for problem solving. 
            
            <br>My work experience is mainly in the environmental sector, and I would love to eventually put my new skills to use in this sector.</p>

            <p>Writing is one of the best ways to learn, and learning sparks so many ideas for writing. While I’m learning to code (a long process!) I’m going to use this corner to write about anything that inspires me – from diversity in tech to how to guides, to more obscure topics. </p>

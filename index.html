        <h1> <b>Agnes Beviz</b> </h1>
        <p>I’m transitioning to software development from the environmental sector, with a background in physics. I’ll be creating while I learn to code, and posting my writing and projects over here. </p>

            <h2>About me..</h2>
            <p>Programming combines my passion for working with technical and creative mediums. I’ve always been curious and interested in how things work, which has led me to learning to code, via building my own PC!</p> 
            <br>
            <p>I’m started off with HTML, CSS and JavaScript – initially with free community developed resources like freeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. Already I’m finding that the problem solving approach and analytical thinking from my Physics Masters is kicking in!</p>
            <br>
            <p>In September 2022 I started working as a Trainee Software Engineer in the UK civil service sector, on a programme that involves applied learning while working on teams. I’m excited about the opportunities this brings, and looking forward to contributing to a service that has millions of users.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I’m also completing a 6 month Software Engineer course with Manchester Codes which I started in May 2022, covering:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML & CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript & ES6</li>
                <li>Git, Github & CLI</li>
                <li>Test Driven Development</li>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Docker</li>
                <li>Node & Jest</li>
                <li>MySQL</li>
                <li>API development</li>
                <li>Express.js</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>I’m enjoying the course – it’s project based, and great to learn as part of a cohort after self-teaching. We do a lot of pair and group programming, and having a clear curriculum with support has accelerated my learning. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The “lift as you climb” (or in my case at the moment, “lift as you learn”!) approach resonates with me, and I’m learning in public sharing my experiences on social media and my blog. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I’m looking forward to keep learning and start my first role in Software Engineering!</p>

            <h2>Blog</h2>
            <p>Writing is one of the best ways to learn, and learning sparks so many ideas for writing. While I’m learning to code I’m going write here about anything that inspires me – from diversity in tech, to how to guides, to more obscure topics. </p>

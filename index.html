        <h2>About me..</h2>
        <p id="text-body">Threaded throughout my work and volunteer experience, I’ve always had a passion for using technology to ‘make life easier’ and been the go-to person to build that project website / automate that task. 
            Building my own PC has inspired me to learn to code, starting off with community resources like FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. In previous roles when I dabbled in web development I would ad-hoc look up HTML / CSS markup for the task at hand. Now I’m enjoying learning more methodically and also putting my skills into practise in projects! 
            
            I studied physics because I wanted to learn more about how the world around me works. Though I didn’t quite figure all of that out, my physics degree has given me a solid grounding in logic and creativity for problem solving. 
            
            In my spare time I like to cycle, hike, and make or fix things. I’m also part of a housing co-op, where we work together in a group to manage the houses we live in. Community is very important to me, and I’ve always been involved in projects and building connections. 
            
            My work experience is mainly in the environmental sector, and I would love to eventually put my new skills to use in this sector.</p>

This is a portfolio website for Agnes Beviz, showcasing projects and articles. The website also has a resources page where I will be adding to over with resources to learn to code. 

The github pages site should redirect to  https://www.agnesbeviz.co.uk/ . 

No templates were used when putting the website together. It's currently HTML & CSS only.

        <article>
            <p>At the weekend I went to a twitter space on Content Creation Strategy hosted by Eddie Jaoude, with Emma Wain, Emma Dawson, Naomi Carrigan, Simon Hoiberg, Pradumna Saraf, Rizèl Scarlett, @dev_hopefuture and @vyvy_vim . </p>

            <p>It was my first twitter space, and very useful to get some tips on how to use the platform. </p><br>
            
            <p>I started posting on LinkedIn in March, and only started writing on twitter in the last couple of weeks. I struggle to edit my posts down to 3000 characters, so getting down to 280 is even trickier! </p><br>
            
            <p><b>What is a Twitter Space?</b></p>
            <p>A twitter space is basically a live-streamed audio panel available on android and iOS. When someone you follow goes live in a twitter space, it appears in purple bubbles at the top of your Twitter timeline. There can be up to 13 speakers in a space, and the host can switch people in the audience to become speakers. </p><br>
            
            <p>During the event I managed to ask a question, overcoming an embarrassing technical glitch where I accidentally interrupted another speaker! </p>
            Several of the speakers had managed to build up their following on social media while learning to code. </p>
            <p>I asked about <b>how to balance creating content at the same time as learning to code</b>, as both take time and energy! They had some great tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do #100daysofcode  - tweet daily updates about learning to code. This helps with motivation, accountability, and structure.</li>
                <li>Learn in public - post updates about different aspects of what you’re learning / what interests you, it’s really useful to be able to ask questions in safe spaces (it’s quite quick to find these once you start)</li>
                <li>Join tech communities aligned with the topics you’re learning about</li>
                <li>Sharing content helps with remembering things - you have a reference of everything on your timeline</li>
                <li>Formulating content to share in public helps with learning </li>
                <li>Don’t put too much pressure on yourself and take breaks, it’s easy to get overwhelmed with the constant stream of content. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I had already started doing 100 Days of Code on twitter - it’s really handy if you don’t have many followers: the tweets are more likely to be seen, and you can engage with others who are doing the same. </p><br>
            
            <p>There were also <b>key points for content creation</b> in general, and the speakers had different approaches on some:
            <ul>
                <li>Pros & cons of sharing personal content and how to manage a balance - some speakers had a separate professional account, and others just used their original socials. </li>
                <li>Dealing with imposter syndrome - if someone is struggling to get started, it’s good to focus on just posting, and can focus on improving quality over time.</li>
                <li>Content that’s more general can get shared more, but focused content is more likely to engage followers, and bring in followers who add value. </li>
                <li>Feedhive is a useful analytics and scheduling tool for twitter & has a heatmap showing when your followers are most active</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I would recommend twitter spaces as a way for getting involved with communities on twitter. After the first event I went to, I saw how easy it was to join / leave the events when they came up. The next step will be to host one!</p>

        <p>Hereâ€™s a list of a list of free self-paced courses & resources for learning programming online. Currently Iâ€™m following the freeCodeCamp curriculum, and am really enjoying it!<p>


        <p>ðŸ§­ For the self-taught route, it's useful to have a way to navigate which technologies to learn and in what order ðŸ¡† <a href="https://roadmap.sh/" class="resource_link" target="_blank">https://roadmap.sh/</a> does just that.<p><br>
            
            
        <p>ðŸ“œ <a href="https://lnkd.in/dKrDsMyM" class="resource_link" target="_blank">Codecademy</a><br>
            Has great introductory courses for beginners with an easy to use interface. Many introductory courses are free, but you will need to pay a subscription for advanced courses and to get certificates. Good starting point if you are a completely new to programming.<p>
            
        <p>ðŸ“œ <a href="https://lnkd.in/dumY_2Yp" class="resource_link" target="_blank">CS50x</a><br>
            Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x) is a course by Harvard University available for free online. Itâ€™s an entry level course and teaches how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. The curriculum is free, but to get the certificate you will need to sign up to the course via edX and pay.<p>
            
        <p>ðŸ“œ <a href="https://lnkd.in/dkE_niDM" class="resource_link" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a><br>
            As the name states, this course is completely free! On completion of each section you get certificates which can be added to your LinkedIn profile. This is one of the most popular free self-paced online courses, with a complete & in depth curriculum.
            
        <p>ðŸ“œ <a href="https://lnkd.in/dEFCBsyW" class="resource_link" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a><br>
        Built by volunteers, the Odin Project is a free open source curriculum with a very user friendly format. It takes students through a â€˜Foundationsâ€™ course, covering essential tools and basic web development. Students can then take a more in depth â€˜Full stack Ruby on Railsâ€™ or â€˜Full stack JavaScriptâ€™ pathway.</p>
            
        <p>ðŸ“œ <a href="https://lnkd.in/dhhpqH7p" class="resource_link" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a><br> 
            Personalised learning in different subject areas â€“ their Computer Programming course teaches HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The course has a focus on games, visualisations and simulations, so depending on your area of interest it could be a good one to take.</p>
            
        <p>ðŸ“œ <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" class="resource_link" target="_blank">w3schools</a><br>
        Has free tutorials for beginners on many different programming languages. It can be used for complete courses â€“ Iâ€™ve often just used it to look up functions / sections of code. This one comes up often when you google!</p>
            
        <p>Some of these resources (freeCodeCamp, Odin Project & w3schools) are open source, which means you can contribute to them after learning! ðŸ’ª</p>
